The tests in this package do not include pretty layout. Therefore,
when you touch layout logic you have to test visually
at least the next cases:
- DeliveryFullInvoice:
 		With <reference-view reference="invoice" frame="true"/>
 		and  <reference-view reference="invoice" frame="false"/>
 		in FullInvoice view of Delivery   
 		The problem may be in layout of bottom element (outside invoice reference)
- Customer: seller with relationWithSeller group
- InvoiceNestedSections2: On select the section data > details 
	the section has not to be duplicated (it was a bug) 		
- Invoice: Inside Liferay, buttons inside portlets
- A section with only a property (enmarcable and not enmarcable) inside Liferay
 		with more portlets below. The frame of the OX porltet mustn't wrap all other portlets.
- Product5FamilyFromSubfamily: The properties in the group must be in the same line
